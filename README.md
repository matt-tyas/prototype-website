# bb-prototype-website

> Front-end website prototype template.

## Using the template

First things first, install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [Grunt.js CLI](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)

Then, once you have the project downloaded, run the command `npm install` in the root of the project.

Once this finishes running, you can build the project by running the command `grunt`

[TODO: Loads more documentation]

Do not edit files in the grunt generated __/dist__ directory (these will always be deleted).

### Adding packages
When you install any new npm packages use the command:
`npm install <package> --save-dev`

You can also use our Yeoman generator
[TODO: Actually build the generator]

### What is [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/)?

In one word: automation. The less work you have to do when performing repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc, the easier your job becomes. After you've configured it, a task runner can do most of that mundane work for you—and your team—with basically zero effort.

[Find out more at the Grunt.js website](http://gruntjs.com/).

### What is [Assemble](http://assemble.io/)?

Assemble is a component and static site generator that makes it dead simple to build modular sites, documentation and components from reusable templates and data.

* Documentation
* Plugins - Plugins extend the core functionality of Assemble.
* Helpers - Documentation for the helpers in the [handlebars-helpers](http://github.com/assemble/handlebars-helpers) library.
